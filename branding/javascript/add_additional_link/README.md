Add additional link to login page
======

To add an additional customizable link to the login screen, add this to your custom JS.

You have the ability to edit the title of the link and the link itself;
- Replace "https://CHANGEME.com" with the URL you wish to direct users to.
- Replace "Change Hover Title" with what you want to display on mouse hover.
- Replace "Custom Display Title" with the wording you would like to display.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind.
Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the
community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this
documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
