- Configure height by replacing '400px' with desired height of iFrame.
- Configure width by replacing '647px' with desired width of iFrame.
- Configure margin by replacing '75px' with desired margin size.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind.
Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the
community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this
documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
