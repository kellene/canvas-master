Login Text
======

You can use this script to add some text to the login screen just below the login button and other items on the screen. You can add multiple lines of text that will wrap and make the modal taller.

- Edit the variable added_text to contain the text you want to display on screen below the "Log In" button.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind.
Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the
community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this
documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
