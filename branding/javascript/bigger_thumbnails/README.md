Bigger Thumbnails
======

This script will resize the thumbnails used for Kaltura and YouTube.

In this script you have the ability to edit the sizing;
- In the 'replace' fields, enter in the dimensions you wish to have the thumbnail resized from/to.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind.
Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the
community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this
documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
