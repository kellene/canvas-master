# Hide Various Course Settings

Some institutions don't need one or more of the course settings options and buttons that Canvas displays in the course settings area. This CSS contains various CSS to hide certian options. Please review the comments in the CSS to see which CSS hides which options.

**Note**: As with any part of Canvas, the links that these CSS rules target could change at any time. Be sure to check your beta environment before each production release to be sure that none of your CSS has broken due to an upcoming code change.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind.
Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the
community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this
documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
