This project is a simple JAVA client for submitting SIS files to the Canvas API.  The file
src/com/kajigga/CanvasAPIPost.java is an example of how this library might be
used.

There are some requirements to making this all work.  These include the
following:

- Google's JSON reading library, GSON (info: https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/)
- Apache's HTTPS Component libary for Java (info: http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/quickstart.html)

For convenience sake, these libraries have been included in the lib folder of this
project.
