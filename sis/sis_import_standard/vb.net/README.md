Windows-based SIS Integration Automation
======

NOTE: This method is not the most reliable method of doing the integration.  Installing 
CURL on Windows proves to be fairly problematic and error prone.  I recommend you look
into using the Powershell scripts instead at https://github.com/kajigga/canvas-contrib/tree/master/SIS%20Integration/powershell_integration.

This folder includes a VB.net script useful for sending once CSV at a time via the 
Canvas API.
