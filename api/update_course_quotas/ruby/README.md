# Update Course Quotas

There needs to be a column named `course_id`, this is going to be the SIS ID of the course you want to update the quota for.

There needs to be a column named `quota`. This column needs to be an integer, and will be converted into MB, so 500 will become 500MB.

Please see the `example.csv` as a template.

*Note:* The course_id should be the SIS ID value.
