# Update Blank Course SIS ID Values

The first column needs to be named `canvas_course_id`, this will be the Canvas ID that is displayed in the URL of the course.

The second column need to be named `new_course_id`, this will be the new SIS ID for the course.

Please see the `example.csv` as a template to structure your CSV file.

*Note:* Both column ID values must be the SIS ID of the course.
