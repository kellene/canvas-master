#Bulk add parents as observers

This script can be used to add parents as observers en masse. It does this by reading a
CSV file with two columns, _parent_id_ and _student_id_. Here is a sample.

    parent_id,student_id
    sis_user_id:rickybobby,sis_user_id:bobby



## Support
As always, this is provided AS-IS, without warranty, and without any support beyond this
document and anyone kind enough to help from the community.

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind. Instructure won't be
able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the community will hopefully help support
and keep both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
