List All Admins
===============================

This script demonstrates a proof of concept of fetching and outputting a list
of all admins in a Canvas account. It uses the provisioning report API and
Account Admins API to do it.

Required Setup
==============
This python script uses 2 non-default modules, requests and canvas_api. You can
install them both like this.

.. code:: sh

  pip install requests py_canvas_api


Support
========

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in 
mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this.
That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep
both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
