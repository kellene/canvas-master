#Prepopulate Modules


##General Information
This script can be used to prepopulate the Canvas Modules list with Module headings. Preopoulating modules can give instructors a "starting point" and students a consistent experience across courses.

More importantly, this is a riff on the update_notification_preferences to show the flexibility of this handy script. 

##Using this script
To run this script, you will need a list of course IDs in the desired term (eg: use the "Unpublished Courses" report before the term begins to generate a list). Additionally, you may want data to prepopulate into modules (eg: number of sessions, course dates). Note: some characters may cause problems (# or ,) and quotes are not necessary
