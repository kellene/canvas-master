# Bulk Course Export

When creating the `input_example.csv` there needs to be a column need to be named `course_id` for the courses that need an export package created.
This value is going to be the Canvas course ID shown in the URL when in the course.

Create a blank CSV file for the output file. It will create two columns, the first being `course_id` which is going to be the Canvas course ID the URL.
The second column is going to be the `export_url` and this will be a direct download URL for the export package.

Please look at the example CSV files named `input_example.csv` & `output_example.csv` for samples.
