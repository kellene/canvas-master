 You will need to edit several variables here at the top of this script. 
 $token = the access token from Canvas
 $workingPath = the full working path to where the csv files are created.  
    This is where the logs and archive folders will be created
 $CSVFileName = the name of course copy CSV file as it will be created in
    the $workingPath.
 $domain = the full domain name you use to access canvas. (i.e. something.instructure.com)

$token = "<token_here>" # access_token
$workingPath = "C:\Users\kevinh\Desktop\CanvasImport\"; # Important! Make sure this ends with a backslash

$migration_base_url = "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1647772/migration_files/" # The base URL for finding course archives.  This should end with a forward slash "/"
$canvas_domain = "yourdomain.test.instructure.com"  # Your Canvas domain.  Use the .test area at first


# These are good defaults if you base your file on the example file
$source_archive_filename_column = "source_filename"
$destination_course_id_column = "destination_id"

$move_csv_file_to_archive = $false; # change this to $true if you want to move the CSV
                                    # file after the copy is completed
