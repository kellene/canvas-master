HTML Module Warnings
======
- DEPRECATED AS OF 04/19/2016

This script appends information to the warning box displayed when an HTTP:// external link is used for a module item in Canvas.

*Note:* To replace the content instead of appending change the .append to .html


Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind.
Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the
community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this
documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
